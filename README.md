# ObsidianAgent-Ogent

This project is a personal fork and customization of [OpenAgent for Obsidian](https://github.com/nikitaclicks/obsidian-openagent).
The upstream project and its original license are retained as the foundation; this repository contains my ongoing UI, agent, and tool improvements.

An AI agent that lives inside your vault — vault-aware, tool-capable, BYOK, and cross-platform (desktop + mobile).

> **Hackathon build:** See [hackathon/README.md](./hackathon/README.md) for the Gemma 4 hackathon submission story, local MLX setup, eval results, and demo assets.

## Features

- **Context-aware Agent**: current note, folder, selection, heading, tags, Properties, and linked notes are shown as removable context chips.
- **Plan and safety modes**: Ask, Plan, and Full access modes with vault-relative path checks, Diff previews, session approval, and undo snapshots.
- **Web research**: Tavily/Brave search plus public HTML fetching with citation metadata, SSRF protections, and untrusted-content boundaries.
- **Session reliability**: streaming event traces, restart recovery, context meter, compaction, queueing, and Markdown copying.

- **OpenAI-compatible provider** — works with OpenAI, Anthropic (via proxy), Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Vault tools** — read, write, edit, append, search, list notes, manage frontmatter and links
- **Consent & safety** — per-action confirmation dialogs with diff previews before any destructive write
- **BYOK** — bring your own API key; no data leaves your vault except to the endpoint you configure
- **Cross-platform** — same bundle runs on desktop (macOS / Windows / Linux) and mobile (iOS / Android)

## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins

Search for **OpenAgent** in Settings → Community Plugins → Browse.
Or simply open this page and press 'Add to Obsidian': https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/open-agent

### Manual install

1. Download `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
2. Copy them into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/open-agent/`.
3. In Obsidian: Settings → Community Plugins → enable **OpenAgent**.

### Mobile

Sync the plugin folder to your mobile vault's `.obsidian/plugins/open-agent/` via Obsidian Sync or any file-sync tool.

## Configuration

Open Settings → OpenAgent and fill in:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Agent memory | Plugin-local stable preferences and decisions | `empty` |
| Network access | Approval policy for public web search and fetching | `Ask` |
| Base URL | Your provider's API endpoint | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| API Key | Your API key | — |
| Model | Model name to use | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| System prompt | Optional system-level instruction | — |

## Privacy & network use

The plugin may contact the configured LLM endpoint, the selected web search provider (Tavily or Brave), the Obsidian community plugin directory, and public URLs explicitly fetched through `web_fetch`.


With vault tools enabled, the agent may transmit note bodies, paths, frontmatter, and tags to that endpoint — only use endpoints you trust.

Your API keys are stored in `.obsidian/plugins/open-agent/data.json`. If you sync your `.obsidian/` folder (e.g. via Obsidian Sync), the keys travel with it. Never commit this file or paste keys into `OpenAgent.md`, Agent memory, notes, or issue reports.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikitaclicks/obsidian-openagent.git
cd obsidian-openagent
npm install
npm run dev        # esbuild watch → writes main.js
```

Then copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` into a test vault at `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/open-agent/` and enable the plugin.

```bash
npm run build      # production bundle
npm run lint       # TypeScript ESLint
```
